enemies e1...en
xp reward function XP(playerLevel,enemyLevel)
level formula L(xp)

enemies		e_i
level 		L(xp)
xp reward	battleXP(L_p,L_e)
			battleXP increasing in L_e and decreasing in L_p

what do I want

1 L + xp should be related linearly/exponentially/constantly/convex
2 L should be a floor function with sudden jumps
3 some set of enemies
4 where killing strong enemies at the start maximizes the values of those enemies, but makes subsequent creatures worth less

such that there are interesting choices
